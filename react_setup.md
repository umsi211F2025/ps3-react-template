## Getting Started: Setting Up Your React App

To help you learn the process of starting a React project, you are responsible for setting up your own app from scratch. Here is a step-by-step outline of what you need to do. (You will definitely want to use Copilot to help you with this!)

1. Create a new React project using Vite, a modern build tool. Set up the project to use TypeScript.
2. Check that the vite test app runs in a browser
3. In the directory for the app, set up the testing framework with Vitest and React Testing Library. This may require installing some additional dependencies and configuring your project. Be sure to configure Vitest to work with your Vite + TypeScript setup. Make sure it is set up to use jest-dom as well. Be sure these are installed in the app directory, not at top level in the repo.
4. Create a simple test that checks that the main App component renders without crashing. Make sure you can run the test and see that they pass.
5. Add to the `.gitignore` file any kinds of files that should not be tracked by git (e.g., `node_modules`, build artifacts).
6. Commit your initial project setup to git with a clear commit message. Note that this is already a git repostitory, so you do not need to run `git init` in the app directory.
