# Problem Set 3: Open-Ended React App

## Overview

For this assignment, you will create a single-page React app that is **either**:
- A typing tutor to help users practice and improve their typing skills, **or**
- A memorization tool to help users learn and recall poems, speeches, or lines for acting.
- Something else that you propose and get approved by the instructor.

You will use Copilot as a coding assistant, but you must actively design, test, and iterate on your app. The assignment emphasizes both the final product and your development process.

You will need to start by getting set up with React and creating a new project. Follow the instructions in `react_setup.md` to set up a new React project using Vite.

## Requirements
- Your app must be a single-page React app (no routing required)
- Follow the course React coding practices (see `react_practices.md`)
- The app must be interactive and provide feedback to the user
- You must have at least five automated tests. Recall that for React development, our process is to create a test only when the implemented app is not working as expected. Thus, this should reflect at least five things that you needed to fix, that the copilot did not get right the first time.
- You must document your design and development process (see Deliverables)

## Deliverables
- **Work Log:** Keep a clear, timestamped log of each work session in your `work-log.md` file.
- **Copilot Usage and Self-reflections:** In your `reflections.md` file this week, include an entry for each thing that was not working as you intended, and reflect on the process of describing the issue, having the copilot generate a test, and then fixing the issue. If you discovered any particularly effective prompts, include them. Also include any self-reflections at the end of the file, as with previous `reflections.md` files.
- **App Code:** All source code for your app, following the course React practices.
- **README.md:** Briefly describe your app, its features, and how to run it and exercise important features.
